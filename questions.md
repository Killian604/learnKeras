# Questions:
- Are we planning on using google colabs?  Can this be set up to pull directly from the repo?
- Do I just feed the requirements.txt to pip somehow?  Can this be fed to conda?

# Some exploratory questions:
- Why use RNNs if they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem?
- Are there things that GRUs can do that LTSMs can't do?
- At what point do performance b/w LTSMs and GRUs diverge?
